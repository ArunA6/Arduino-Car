# Arduino Autonomous Car Project

Arun Atchuthanthan

Built August 2019

This autonomous car project was developed as a personal robotics project to apply Arudino and robotics skills I had gained over past years. I built the car using a small arudion model kit, which I expanded upon using 3D Printed parts that I had specifically modelled for this project. The current version of the code uploaded here on GitHub is the base version I create for testing of the car's physical functionality and the stability of the parts in an autonomous driving scenario.

Using this code, the car has a base level of autonimity provided to it by UltraSonic Sensors and obstacle detection. Unfortunately, futher iterations which included infrared-based path tracking and colour-based traffic light detection were lost. If the code for these iterations is found, I intend on updating this repository and possibly recreating the project to provide live examples.

If you would like to get started with Arduino, learn about my building/coding process for this project, or collaborate in future Arduino project, please feel free to contact me!
